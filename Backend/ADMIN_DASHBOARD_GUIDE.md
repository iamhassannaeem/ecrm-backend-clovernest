## üîß Permission Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Organization Member with Limited Permissions
1. Create user with `ORG_MEMBER` role
2. Assign only `READ` permissions for `USER` and `ADMIN_PANEL`
3. Test access to various endpoints
4. Verify they can only read user data, not modify

### Scenario 2: Organization Admin with Full Access
1. Create user with `ORGANIZATION_ADMIN` role
2. Test all organization management endpoints
3. Verify they can manage members and permissions
4. Confirm they cannot access super admin features

### Scenario 3: Super Admin with Platform Access
1. Use super admin account
2. Test platform-wide analytics
3. Test organization management across all orgs
4. Test user role assignments

## üö® Security Testing

### Test Permission Boundaries
1. **Cross-Organization Access**: Ensure users cannot access other organizations
2. **Role Escalation**: Verify users cannot elevate their own permissions
3. **Admin Protection**: Confirm admin permissions cannot be modified by non-admins
4. **Super Admin Protection**: Ensure only designated super admins have platform access

### Test Authentication
1. **Token Validation**: Test with invalid/expired tokens
2. **Role Verification**: Test endpoints with insufficient permissions
3. **Organization Context**: Test with wrong organization IDs
